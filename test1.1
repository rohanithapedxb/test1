Certainly! To add a new file directly via the GitHub web interface:

   - Select "Create new file" from the dropdown.

3. **Name the New File:**
   - In the text field where it says "Name your file...", enter the name of your new file, including the file extension (e.g., `new_file.txt`).

4. **Add Content:**
   - You can optionally add content to the file by typing directly into the editing area. This step is not mandatory if you're creating an empty file.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
   - You'll see a section labeled "Commit new file."
   - Enter a commit message in the "Commit changes" field (e.g., "Add new_file.txt").

   - Finally, click the "Commit new file" button to add the new file to your repository.

Once you've completed these steps, the new file will be added to your GitHub repository directly through the web interface. You'll see the file listed in your repository's file structure.
